Hello everyone!
This is my second Data Science project
This one is a bit more valuable than my first project
Let's talk about it's purpose
Let's assume that you want to buy or sell your house in US
But you don't know the actual prices. For example, you have no idea what is the cost of a large house that is located close to a sea, with about 10 rooms and so on...
This program will provide you an estimated price of a house which is X years old, is of Y size in sq. ft., has Z rooms and has some of 11 available sights...

Note: The dataset is AI generated! The real prices may vary and the cities in the dataset may be surrouned by the land however they may allegedly be located close to the sea ***
